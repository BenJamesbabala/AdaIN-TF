# AdaIN-TF

This is a TensorFlow/Keras implementation of [Arbitrary Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868).

# Acknowledgments

Many thanks to the author Xun Huang for the excellent [original Torch implementation](https://github.com/xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style) that saved me countless hours of frustation. I also drew inspiration from Jon Rei's [TF implementation for the .t7 pre-trained decoder](https://github.com/jonrei/tf-AdaIN) and borrowed the clean TF code for the AdaIN transform.
